        As one of the busiest business districts in Metro Manila, Makati is one of the most modern urban destinations in the Philippines. It offers the convenience of other major international cities but for a hassle-free trip, take note of these insider tips:
      </p>
      <dl>
        
        <dt>Currency</dt><br>
          <dd>
            The majority of establishments (from hotels, malls, to restaurants) in Makati accept credit cards. ATMs and banks are also visible in significant roads and malls so you can quickly withdraw or exchange foreign currency to Philippine Peso (PHP). 
          </dd><br>
        <dt>Language</dt><br>
          <dd>
            Locals speak Filipino and English. Most of the people in Makati are employees that come from different parts of the Metro and the Philippines, but the majority of them are fluent in English. 
          </dd><br>
        <dt>Traffic Policies</dt><br>
          <dd>
            Because of the large number of people going in and out of Makati, the local government enforces strict traffic laws including designated loading and unloading stations for public and private vehicles, especially in major roads. If you are driving yourself with a rented car or other types of cars, download navigation apps like Google Map or Waze. 
          </dd><br>
        <dt>Rush Hour</dt><br>
          <dd>
            It's essential to take note that rush hour or the busiest traffic hours in Makati are from 6 to 8 AM and 5 to 8 PM. These are the hours when going to offices and going home to destinations in and outside of the city.

        How to Get to Makati
      </h1><br>
      <p>
        People riding the LRT in Manila
        Makati is located in the central part of Metro Manila and is accessible from neighboring cities and airports. If it's your first time to go here, it might be confusing as to which transportation option is best for you because of the many choices available. In this section, we'll break down for you the different ways to go to Makati:   
      </p><br>
      <dl>
        <dt>By Bus</dt> <br>
          <dd>Regular buses are coming from North and South of Metro Manila that passes by Makati. Look out for the signage that says Ayala LRT if you want a bus that will travel through Ayala Avenue or one of the significant roads inside Makati. <br> 

          These days, the Premium P2P bus service, an initiative by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) has given commuters and even tourists the ease and peace of mind of traveling around Metro Manila. <br>
              
          One-way fare starts at PHP100. You can check the schedules and routes of P2P buses here that go to/from Makati. Pick-up and drop-off terminals in Makati for P2P buses are usually in malls like Greenbelt and Glorietta.</dd><br>
        <dt>By Train</dt> <br>
          <dd>If you donâ€™t mind roughing it, take the Metro Rail Transit (MRT). Taking the train is, by far, the cheapest way to go to Makati from other major cities of Metro Manila like Quezon City, Pasig, Mandaluyong, and Pasay. <br>

          The MRT line travels along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue or EDSA, and you can get off at Ayala Station (near Makati CBD) if you're heading to Makati. One-way fare starts at PHP13.00.</dd><br>
        <dt>By Taxis/Cabs</dt> <br>
          <dd>
            Regular taxi or cabs ply the major thoroughfares of Metro Manila, including Makati. All metered taxis and cabs in the city have a standard flag-down rate of PHP40.00. <br>

            If you're coming from the airport, you will have the option of a regular metered white taxi/cab or the premium yellow taxi/cab.
          </dd><br>
        <dt>Useful Apps</dt> <br>
          <dd>Flagging down taxi or cabs can be difficult, especially during rush hour in Makati. Foreign travelers might also find riding public transportation challenging when going to Makati so we highly suggest using these apps when traveling to Makati. <br>

          This way, you can sit back, relax, and let someone else navigate the Metro Manila and Makati traffic. <br>
            <dl>
              <dt>Taxi/Cab, Car, and Carpool Booking Apps </dt>
              <dd>
                For a more comfortable ride, you can hail a cab or use transportation apps like Grab or Owto that offer accredited taxi/cabs, private cars, and carpool. You can also book this if you're coming from the airports. Do take note that the fares vary on the time of day you make a booking. 
              </dd><br>
              <dt>Motorcycle Booking App</dt>
              <dd>
                If you're only carrying a compact backpack or small bag and don't mind riding a motorcycle, you can download the app Angkas. If it's raining, it's best not to ride this, so you don't get drenched and for your safety as well since roads can be slippery. </dd><br>
